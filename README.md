# TODO
* define cell class (and hopefully remove numpy from requirements)
* replace ugly returns of boolean by something else (try/catch ?)
* improve collision check : for rotations, change anchor if collision and if possible (translation l/r)
* make a class Game that has a gameover attribute to feed to both threads for proper game over
* print board at each fall in thread (probably doable with Game class)
* scoring
* acceleration
* gui ? (-> use pygame)
* proper game over screen
